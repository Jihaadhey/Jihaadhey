      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Mohamed Ahmed, and I proudly serve as a Deputy Minister at
        the Ministry of Cities, Local Government and Public Works in the
        Maldives. Born and raised in the heart of Kulhudhuffushi City, I’ve
        always felt a strong sense of duty to contribute meaningfully to the
        development of our communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional journey began in education, where I worked as a relief
        teacher. Since then, I’ve built over a decade of experience across
        government and utility sectors, holding key roles in operations,
        logistics, human resources, revenue management, and public
        administration. In 2024, I was appointed Deputy Minister, where I now
        oversee the HDh. Cluster Island Councils and manage public works within
        Kulhudhuffushi City.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold academic credentials including completion of the GCE O-Level at
        Jalaaluddin School in 2008, and have further enhanced my professional
        capabilities through multiple trainings in leadership, management,
        communication, and IT.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I am deeply passionate about water sports —
        particularly kiteboarding, wakeboarding, surfing, and fishing — pursuits
        that reflect both my love for nature and my energetic spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        I value integrity, teamwork, service, and continuous improvement, and
        I’m committed to using my skills and experiences to help build a more
        efficient, inclusive, and forward-thinking public sector. My goal is to
        foster sustainable development and empower local communities through
        transparent governance and people-centered solutions.
